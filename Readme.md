## Description

This repository contains the Android Cordova source code for a sample browser app that uses the MAM SDKs for endpoint management.  It does not contain the [MAM SDK](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/mdx-toolkit/mam-sdk-overview.html) libraries themselves, which are downloaded separately.

## Download

The MAM SDK libraries can be downloaded from [MAM SDKs and Toolkit](https://www.citrix.com/downloads/citrix-endpoint-management/product-software/mdx-toolkit.html).

## Documentation

For detailed documentation on how to use this sample app, and compile it, see the [MAM SDK for Android Cordova Overview](https://developer.cloud.com/citrixworkspace/mobile-application-integration/cordova-android/docs/overview).  Documentation is also included in the MAM SDK download package.
